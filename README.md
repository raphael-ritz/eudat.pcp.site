Build and configuration files for EUDATs Project Coordination Portal 

## Quickstart

Clone this repository to start a new instance of the Project Coordination Portal (PCP). From within the resulting folder call `bootstrap.py` using Python 2. Recommended version is 2.7.x but 2.6 should also be supported. Note that Plone and therefore the PCP does not support Python 3 yet. If all goes well you will now find a `bin` directory containing the `buildout` command. Call this now (`bin/buildout`). It will take a while to download, compile and install everything you need provided you have meet the basic requirements of your OS for any Plone site. See http://docs.plone.org/manage/installing/requirements.html for the details.
